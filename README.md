## Debotnet is a free and portable tool for controlling Windows 10's many privacy-related settings and keep your personal data private.

The Windows 10 default privacy settings leave a lot to be desired when it comes to protecting you and your private information. Whenever I set up a new computer or update a current setup for my family or job, I always carefully go through the privacy settings for each install, making sure to lock it down to make it as private as possible.

Windows 10 has raised several concerns about privacy due to the fact that it has a lot of telemetry and online features, which send your data (sensitive and not) to Microsoft and can't be disabled, which means Microsoft can:

* Run software on your computer without your consent
* Get data from your computer without your consent
* Remove software and files from your computer without your consent

This qualifies Windows 10 as malware, and more specifically, a botnet.
